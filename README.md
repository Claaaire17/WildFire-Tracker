# Wildfire Tracker 🔥

This is a React-based web application designed to help users track active wildfires in the United States using real-time data from external APIs. The goal is to present wildfire information in a clear, interactive, and accessible format.

## 📌 Project Status

🚧 **Currently in progress.**  
This project was started during the Summer 2025 semester as a way to deepen my front-end development skills and practice real-world API integration. While the core layout and structure are functional, some UI features are still being debugged and styled.

### ✅ What's Working
- Initial component structure using React
- Basic UI layout and CSS styling
- Project version control with Git/GitHub

### 🧠 Planned Features
- **AI-Powered Natural Language Summaries** of wildfire trends (OpenAI integration or LLM)
- State-by-state map visualization of current wildfires
- Responsive mobile design and accessibility improvements

## 💡 Reflection

This project has been a learning experience in both scope management and technical troubleshooting. My team and I initially planned an ambitious feature set, which led to delays and bugs. However, the process has helped refine my understanding of scalable UI design and version control. I plan to complete core functionality and deploy the application by October 2025.

## 🛠️ Technologies
- React.js
- HTML5/CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- OpenAI API (planned)
